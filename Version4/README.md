Client-Dispatch-Version4

Performs all features of Client-Dispatch-Version3, but now includes additional "Thursday" features. Relevant compound data is copied from individual team/dispatch sheets to the relevant grid-reference of the latest DMPK spreadsheet. If this sheet of defined length becomes full, a new workbook is created. Following insertion of all compound data, individual dispatch spreadsheets are archived in a separate folder.
