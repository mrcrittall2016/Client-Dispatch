# Client-Dispatch

Python and VBA code enables compilation of individual Excel/Word docs containing information related to chemical compounds. All information both structural and otherwise is compiled into a single document which is subsequently relayed to the client.

Key information is extracted from this single document - for example number of samples to dispatch, barcode ranges and quantities. This is used to auto-fill a series of shipment forms required for transport of chemicals overseas by courier.
